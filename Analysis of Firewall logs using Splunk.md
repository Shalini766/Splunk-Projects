# Analysis of Firewall Logs using Splunk
A firewall is important in monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic. These firewall logs give insight into the flow of traffic in the network, what information is being exchanged, open ports, and the source and destination IP addresses. All these will aid in the analysis of activity in the network and improve the network security.

## Steps:

### Step 1: 
The Splunk instance is installed and configured.
Firewall log data sources are configured to forward logs to Splunk.
